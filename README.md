# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section
Social Proof Section challenger designed by Frontend Mentor and coded by YohanR19

*Had a pretty good experience whit the proyect, managed to 
complete the desing whitout having to use display: flex, which
i was getting a little too dependant on, so i am happy that i can
make layouts purely using display: grid (which is actually more potent).
Also is easer to make responsive desings by using Mozilla Responsive Dev Tools
and by using the standar of starting whit mobile desing first.
